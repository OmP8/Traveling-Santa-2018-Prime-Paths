This is a part of my work to the Kaggle Traveling Santa 2018 - Prime Paths competition.
These notebooks in the repository create a 172th place solution (top 10%).

To solve the Travelling salesman problem I used LKH-3.0.5 to get the raw tour as the starting step. Then shuffling and kind of 5-opt with finetuning.
